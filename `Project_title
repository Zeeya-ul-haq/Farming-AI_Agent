Problem Statement No.9 – AI Agent for Smart Farming Advice  
The Challenge – An AI Agent for Smart Farming Advice, powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented 
Generation), supports small-scale farmers by delivering real-time, localized agricultural guidance. 
It retrieves trusted data on weather forecasts, soil conditions, crop recommendations, pest control 
measures, and current market prices from agricultural departments, meteorological sources, and agri
tech platforms. 
Farmers can interact in their local language and ask questions like “What crop is best for this season?” 
or “What is today’s mandi rate for tomatoes?” 
The agent ensures timely, data-driven decisions that reduce risk, increase yield, and boost income. 
This AI-driven assistant bridges the knowledge gap and brings smart farming to the grassroots. 
Technology – Use of IBM Cloud Lite services / IBM Granite is mandatory.
